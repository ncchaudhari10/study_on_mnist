# MNIST Digit Recognition with Supervised Learning

## Project Description

This project explores various supervised machine learning algorithms for classifying handwritten digits on the MNIST dataset. We compare and analyze the performance of different models, including Bayes rule classifiers, autoencoders, neural networks, and more.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 handwritten digit images (28x28 pixels) divided into a training set (60,000) and a test set (10,000).

## Algorithms

- Bayes Rule Classifier
- Autoencoder-based Classifiers
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
- Rotational SVM

## Results

- The project achieved a maximum accuracy of 99.40% using a CNN.
- A detailed comparison of all models' performance is provided in the report, including accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and visualization of training and testing performance.
- Three novel variants of machine learning models were proposed for multi-class classification.

## Dependencies

- Python libraries such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and NumPy
